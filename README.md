# Spring '83

Welcome! This is a draft protocol that I believe might open up some interesting new possibilities on the internet. If you are just discovering it, I recommend reading [this narrative description](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/). Don't miss my notes on [a summer spent operating the protocol with other people](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/#summer), either.

This is speculative software intended to invite consideration and imagination; it doesn't have any "users", only co-investigators.

This project has been quiet for a while, and will remain so for a while longer -- but I'm thinking hard about ways to refine and remix these ideas, and I'll return with some new offerings sometime in 2023.

Current draft:

* [Protocol specification](draft-20220629.md)

Previous drafts:

* [20220619](draft-20220616.md)

If you've implemented a client, server, or utility, at any level of completeness, and you would like me to list it here, let me know.
